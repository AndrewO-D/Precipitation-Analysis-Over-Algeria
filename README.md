# Precipitation-Analysis-Over-Algeria 
ASSIGNMENT QUESTION

For your case study country, download daily data for a period of 10 years and perform the
following assessments using Python Xarray.
.Compute the monthly rainfall totals and compute their longterm climatologies for
each month.
Also, compute the annual totals and average across the country. Produce a timeseries
that provides information on the year-to-year changes and trends.
Compute the number of dry (RR<1mm) and wet (RR>=1mm) days (per month and
per year) for your case study region and present a spatial and timeseries visualization
of the output.
Perform similar analysis as Item 3, but for extreme rainfall indices (RR>10mm;
RR>20mm)
In a scientific report format, discuss your findings from the analysis performed. Your report
should be categorized as such:
.Introduction (including Background, main and specific objectives, and research
questions)
Description of study area and dataset
Methodology (Analysis Methods)
Results and Discussion
Conclusion
Appendix (which must include your code; highlighting their output)
